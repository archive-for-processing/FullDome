FullDome: Tools and Examples
============================


This is a collection of tools and code I came across or I modified for displaying interactive content in a fulldome environment.
I do this as part of a class I'm taking called "Immersive Data Visualisation" at the FH Potsdam.

Tools:

Processing / FullDomeTemplate

Amazing Tool by Christopher Warnow! Warps your Processing Sketch into a dome master with some really nice OpenGL magic.

Processing / SimulationTemplate

The SimulationTemplate creates a movable Dome and projects your interactive Sketches into it.
